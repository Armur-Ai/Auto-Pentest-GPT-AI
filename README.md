## Introduction

PentestAI is an innovative assistant for penetration testing, we used the `OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B` model, we jailbroke it, finetuned it with commands for popular Kali Linux tools and it's now able to provide guided, actionable steps and command automation for performing deep pen tests.
We've launched the updated model here - https://huggingface.co/ArmurAI/Pentest_AI

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

- Operating System: Kali Linux, Windows, or MacOS
- Python version 3.x
- Internet access for downloading necessary files and tools

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python Libraries**: Use `pip install transformers colorama torch` to install required libraries.
2. **Download the Model File**: Obtain `https://huggingface.co/ArmurAI/Pentest_AI` and note its path.
3. **Update Script**: Modify the `model_path` variable in the script to the model file's location.

### Execution

Run the script using `python pentest_ai.py` and follow the interactive prompts.

## Code Explanation with Snippets

### Check and Install Tools

The script starts by checking if necessary penetration testing tools are installed, installing any missing ones:

```python
def check_and_install_tools(tools):
    for tool in tools:
        result = subprocess.run(['which', tool], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        if not result.stdout.strip():
            subprocess.run(['sudo', 'apt-get', 'install', '-y', tool])
```

This function checks each tool in the `tools` list, installing it using `apt-get` if not found.

### Model Initialization

The script loads the `OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B` model with a specific path and configuration:

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("ArmurAI/Pentest_AI")
model_path = "<path_to_model>"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, gpu_layers=12, threads=1)
```

This initializes the tokenizer and model, setting parameters like `gpu_layers` and `threads` for performance optimization.

### Interactive User Interface

The script interacts with the user, asking for input and providing guidance based on the user's actions:

```python
sys_env = input("Select your environment (1, 2, or 3): ")
if sys_env == '1':
    check_and_install_tools(pentest_tools)
```

It prompts the user to select their operating system environment and, if Kali Linux is chosen, it checks for and installs the necessary tools.

### Command Execution

For Kali Linux, the script can execute pentesting commands automatically:

```python
def execute_tool_command(output, ip_address):
    if 'nmap' in output:
        command_output = os.popen(f'nmap -sV {ip_address}').read()
        print(command_output)
```

This function parses the assistant's output for tool names and executes the corresponding command, showing the command output to the user.

## Conclusion

PentestAI is designed to streamline the penetration testing process by integrating AI-powered guidance with practical command execution, making it a powerful tool for security professionals and enthusiasts alike.
